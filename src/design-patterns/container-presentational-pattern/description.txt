☑️Presentational Components: Components that care about how data is shown to the user.
☑️Container Components: Components that care about what data is shown to the user.
⚠️
A presentational component receives its data through props. Its primary function is to simply display the data it receives the way we want them to, including styles, without modifying that data.
⚠️
The primary function of container components is to pass data to presentational components, which they contain.
Container components themselves usually don’t render any other components besides the presentational components that care about their data. Since they don’t render anything themselves, 
they usually do not contain any styling either.

☑️Hooks
In many cases, the Container/Presentational pattern can be replaced with React Hooks.
The introduction of Hooks made it easy for developers to add statefulness without needing a container component to provide that state.
